# Ideas for key usage

## Summary

We have a moldable development environment. When you are developing a software system you have to have
some tools to develop it. The purpose of a moldable development environment is to make the creation of
such tools cheap. Tool creation should be a first-class citizen. How we can make a UI that makes it
delightful and easy to create tools which help you to solve a specific problem?

The next important thing for this environment is for an engineer to be able to change the system on
which they work. This should be either through an LLM/AI, manipulating abstract-syntax trees,
manipulating non-text representations of the system or, in the extreme case, writing code. We have to
find a UI that makes this process delightful and easy.

The overarching workflow should be AI-first.

## Ideas to verify

1. Explore tool creation within Lumina
2. Manipulate abstract syntax trees instead of code
